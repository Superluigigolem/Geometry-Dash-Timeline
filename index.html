            <h2> Geometry Dash made by RobTopGames </h2>
            <p> Version 1.0 was the first Version of Geometry Dash. This Version has the least amount of popularity out of them all and only a few people can claim that they have played the game around this time. It is still referred to the "stepping stone for the later updates" by many Players. When the game released, it had 7 main levels. Stereo Madness, Back On Track, Polargeist, Dry Out, Base After Base, Cant Let Go and Jumper. In 1.0, you can only play as a cube or ship. There is also upside-down gameplay in 1.0. </p>
